# Assignment operators
# Operator  Example     Meaning
# =         x = 10      Assigns 10 to x
# +=        x += 5      Adds 5 to x (x = x + 5)
# -=        x -= 3      Subtracts 3 frrom x
# *=        x *= 2      Multiplies x by 2
# /=        x /= 4      Divides x by 4
# %=        x %= 3      Stores remainder after division
# **=       x **= 2     Raises x to the power of 2
# //=       x //= 2     Floor divides x by 2

# Logical operators
# Operator  Example             Meaning
# and       x > 5 and x < 15    True if both conditions are true
# or        x < 5 or x > 20     True if at least one condition is true
# not       not(x == 10)        True if the condition is false
